          <h2>ABN AMRO fined USD 1 million for segregation of customer funds and minimum net capital failings</h2>

          <p1>On 18 June 2013 the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago USD 1 million (EUR 748,000) for failing to segregate or secure sufficient customer funds, failing to meet the minimum net capital requirements, failing to maintain accurate books and records, and failing to supervise its employees.</p1>

          <p1>Between 19 March 2009 and January 2012, ABN AMRO reported four instances in which it had failed to segregate sufficient funds to margin, guarantee, or secure customers’ trades or contracts. Each of these violations was the result of clerical errors and/or a lack of adequate policies and procedures related to the movement of customer funds. </p1>

          <p1>In addition, ABN AMRO lacked adequate margin compliance procedures. During a routine audit of ABN AMRO’s books and records at the close of business on 31 May 2011, the CME Group, ABN AMRO’s designated self-regulatory organisation, found that ABN AMRO had improperly used a customer’s withdrawn warehouse receipts as collateral for margining purposes. Without these warehouse receipts, the customer’s accounts were under-margined on several occasions, and ABN AMRO had to reduce its adjusted net capital by an amount equal to the margin deficits. Once these reductions were calculated, it was determined that ABN AMRO had failed to meet the minimum net capital requirements at month-end for April 2011.Furthermore, the CFTC conducted a limited review of ABN AMRO beginning on 27 January 2012 and identified additional issues with ABN AMRO’s margining procedures. The primary deficiency noted was that ABN AMRO relied on a commonly used commercial accounting software program to calculate and generate its customer margin call listing. This particular software program is unable to calculate the correct amount of margin required for a very limited number of certain types of accounts (such as omnibus accounts that offset margin requirements for certain credit spread transactions). </p1>

          <p1>Although margin calls were issued as necessary to the relevant accounts, ABN AMRO did not maintain a supplemental report or record of the margin requirements for these types of accounts. As a result, ABN AMRO was unable to produce a complete and accurate margin report listing for those accounts, thereby failing to keep accurate books and records sufficient to determine the margin status of each customer.\xa0The CFTC found that these violations were a result of a lack of adequate policies, procedures, and/or controls and, for the most part, were preventable, reflecting a lack of supervisory controls over the activities of its partners, employees, and agents. ABN AMRO failed to implement an adequate system of internal controls and procedures regarding customer movement of funds to ensure compliance with the segregation and foreign futures and foreign options secured amount requirements, failed to implement accounting procedures to reduce the likelihood of clerical errors and forecasting errors, failed to implement adequate procedures and training regarding exchange margin requirements, and failed to implement adequate policies and procedures to ensure an accurate and complete daily margin report. In addition to the fine, the CFTC ordered ABN AMRO to retain an independent consultant to review and evaluate the effectiveness of its existing internal controls, policies, procedures and risk management systems and to adopt any recommendations for improvement made by the consultant.'</p1>

The idea is to cut costs and create a more manageable bank. <span class="strikethrough">The strategy has also involved a retreat from some markets that Nordea has defined as too risky, including a partial withdrawal from the Baltics and Russia.</span><span class="strikethrough">“If I would name one player which everyone in banking is looking at, it’s</span> Amazon<span class="strikethrough">,” he said. “That’s the </span> one that’s operating differently. The adjacency to banking is so much closer than for Google or Apple or Facebook.” The biggest opportunity to profit from using robotics, artificial intelligence and digitization is at the so-called front end, where the bank meets the customer, <span class="strikethrough">he said.</span> The areas where human contact is still key are services like helping customers with their mortgages and giving them advice on managing their wealth.
