			<h1>One Hundred People</h1>
			<h2>A force directed chart</h2>
			<p>This is a force directed chart where the world’s population is represented as if it was composed by one hundred people, according to different variables that you can change: sex, access to drinkable water, blood type, religion etc. If the world was made of one hundred people, for instance, 84 would be literate, while 16 would be illiterate.</p>
			<p>Change the variable clicking on the list at the left-hand side. For representing one hundred people with round numbers, I’m using the JavaScript function <em>Math.round()</em>, which rounds to the nearest integer. For having a better representation of the (more) precise numbers, a stacked bar chart is provided at the bottom.</p>
